Deploy the backend

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

    SAM CLI - Install the SAM CLI
    Node.js - Install Node.js 10, including the NPM package management tool.
    Docker - Install Docker community edition

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell from the serverless-backend/ directory:

sam build
sam deploy --guided

The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts. You'll be asked for the UserPoolID and AmplifyStackName created by the Amplify CLI. Those values can be found in the amplify-frontend/amplify/backend/amplify-meta.json file generated by Amplify.

Once deployed, the SAM cli will output an API Endpoint. Create a file, api-config.js in the amplify-frontend/src/ directory with the endpoint:

const apiConfig = {
    "endpoint": "<ENDPOINT>",
    "s3_bucket_name": "<BucketName>",
    "s3_region": "<S3 REGION>"
};

export default apiConfig;

Run the frontend application

To run the application locally, enter this command from the amplify-frontend/ directory:

npm run serve

To publish the frontend to AWS cloud hosting:

amplify publish
